This repository contains the source code for a basic -- and very insecure -- website.
The website functions as a primitive discussion forum with user accounts, topics,
comments, and file attachments.

*** DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR A PRODUCTION WEBSITE ***

This code is designed for use by students in IT 5233 at Georgia Southern University
to identify and correct security issues. The code is deliberately bad and contains
lots of security issues.
